# Machine-learning-MNSIT-Dataset-
Worked on MNSIT dataset. Trained and tested the dataset using different classifier. Like,k nearest neighbour, Support vector machine, randomforest and  naive bayes
Made an interface, wich predicts the image number based onthe accuracy and results obtained from above classifiers.

The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits, with a total of 70,000 images. In your machine learning project, you trained and tested the dataset using different methods, including:

K-nearest neighbors (KNN): A classification algorithm that predicts the class of a new data point based on the classes of its k nearest neighbors in the training set.

Multilayer perceptron (MLP): A type of artificial neural network that uses multiple layers of interconnected nodes to make predictions.

Support vector machine (SVM): A binary classification algorithm that finds the best hyperplane to separate the classes.

Random forest: An ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes of the individual trees.

From the results te support vctor machine classifier gave the most accurate results
