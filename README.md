# Machine-learning-MNSIT-Dataset-
Worked on MNSIT dataset. Trained and tested the dataset using different classifier. Like,k nearest neighbour, Support vector machine, randomforest and  naive bayes
Made an interface, wich predicts the image number based onthe accuracy and results obtained from above classifiers.
